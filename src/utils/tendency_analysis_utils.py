    You are a tennis tendency analyst. Below is point-by-point data gathered from video analysis of the match between Tsitsipas and Struff.

    Each entry contains:
    - Result: the current point score
    - Winner: the player who won the point
    - Server: the player serving the point
    - Serve Side: either Deuce or Advantage side

    Example data format:
    - "(0-0, 0-0)": ["Sinner", "Sinner", "Deuce"],
    - "(0-0, 15-0)": ["Sinner", "Sinner", "Advantage"],
    ...

    Your task is to analyze this match and extract useful tendencies and insights, such as:
    - Number of points won consecutively
    - Out of X points, how many each player has won
    - Out of X points on the Advantage/Deuce side, how many each player has won
    - Out of X points when player 1/player 2 is serving, how many they have won
    - Out of X points when player 1/player 2 is returning, how many they have won

    After identifying these tendencies (or others that you find useful), provide brief strategic recommendations for each player â€” for example, what patterns to reinforce or adjust.

    Output instructions:
    - Use bullet points
    - Keep the analysis concise (maximum 100 words)
    - Make insights and advice easy to understand
    - Do not invent any data
